# Feature 1.1.6: Integration Tests

## Overview
Implement comprehensive integration tests that verify the entire system works together correctly, testing the interactions between Jido agents, Ash resources, Spark DSL, ETS storage, and framework components.

## Requirements from Implementation Plan
- Test Jido agent lifecycle
- Test Ash resource operations  
- Test Spark DSL compilation
- Test ETS storage operations
- Test framework integration

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Jido Agent Integration Tests
- Agent creation and initialization
- State transitions and updates
- Message passing between agents
- Agent supervision and recovery
- Integration with ETS storage

### 2. Ash Resource Integration Tests
- Resource CRUD operations with ETS backing
- PubSub notifications across components
- Transaction handling
- Resource relationships
- Query performance with ETS indexes

### 3. Spark DSL Integration Tests
- DSL compilation and validation
- Component/System/Entity definitions
- Transformer pipeline execution
- Runtime behavior verification
- Error handling and reporting

### 4. ETS Storage Integration Tests
- Multi-component entity operations
- Concurrent access patterns
- Persistence bridge functionality
- Performance under load
- Recovery and fault tolerance

### 5. Framework Integration Tests
- End-to-end game scenarios
- System scheduling and execution
- Component data flow
- Event propagation
- Performance benchmarks

## Test Organization
- `/test/integration/` - Main integration test directory
- Each subsystem gets its own test module
- Shared test helpers and fixtures
- Performance benchmarks included
