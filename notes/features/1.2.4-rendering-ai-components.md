# Feature: Rendering and AI Components (Task 1.2.4.4 and 1.2.4.5)

## Overview
Complete the remaining Core Game Components by implementing Rendering and AI components for the ECS architecture.

## Requirements
- Create rendering components for visual representation
- Implement AI components for autonomous behavior
- Follow existing ComponentBehaviour patterns
- Ensure serialization support
- Maintain high performance standards

## Components to Implement

### Rendering Components (1.2.4.4)
1. **Sprite** - 2D texture rendering
2. **Animation** - Frame-based animation states
3. **Visibility** - Rendering control and culling
4. **LOD** - Level of detail management

### AI Components (1.2.4.5)
1. **AIController** - Main AI control component
2. **Behavior** - Behavior tree or state machine
3. **Perception** - Sensory awareness system

## Implementation Plan
1. Start with Rendering components (simpler, stateless)
2. Move to AI components (more complex, stateful)
3. Write comprehensive tests
4. Ensure integration with existing systems
