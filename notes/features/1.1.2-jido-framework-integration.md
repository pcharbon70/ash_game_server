# Feature: Jido Framework Integration (Section 1.1.2)

## Summary
Set up comprehensive Jido framework integration for autonomous agent systems in the game server, including runtime configuration, agent infrastructure, signal system, registry, and supervision tree.

## Requirements
- [ ] Configure Jido runtime with supervision and signal routing
- [ ] Create base agent infrastructure with validation and lifecycle management
- [ ] Implement CloudEvents-based signal system for agent communication
- [ ] Set up distributed agent registry using Horde integration
- [ ] Build comprehensive agent supervision tree with fault tolerance
- [ ] Add telemetry integration for agent monitoring
- [ ] Create testing utilities for agent development
- [ ] Implement graceful shutdown and restart strategies

## Research Summary
### Existing Usage Rules Checked
- Jido usage rules: Functional programming with OTP, use schemas for validation, pattern matching for control flow
- OTP usage rules: GenServer best practices, proper supervision strategies, fault tolerance patterns
- Elixir core usage rules: Tagged tuples, pattern matching, avoid nested cases

### Documentation Reviewed
- Jido 1.2.0: Autonomous agent framework with Actions, Agents, Sensors, Skills, and Signals
- Core concepts: Actions as composable units, Agents as stateful orchestrators, Sensors for monitoring
- OTP integration: Supervision trees, dynamic supervisors, GenServer patterns
- Signal system: CloudEvents integration for distributed messaging
- Performance: Can run 10k+ agents at 25KB each, production-ready framework

### Existing Patterns Found
- lib/ash_game_server/application.ex:12-20: Current supervision tree with Repo, Telemetry, PubSub
- lib/ash_game_server/telemetry.ex: Basic telemetry structure ready for agent metrics
- No existing Jido implementation - clean slate for integration

### Technical Approach
1. **Jido Runtime Configuration**: Add Jido supervisor to application tree, configure signal routing
2. **Agent Infrastructure**: Create base agent modules following Jido patterns with state validation
3. **Signal System**: Implement CloudEvents integration with Phoenix PubSub backend
4. **Agent Registry**: Use Horde for distributed agent discovery and management
5. **Supervision Strategy**: Multi-tier supervision with agent pools and restart strategies
6. **Integration**: Connect with existing Telemetry and prepare for ECS integration

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Agent supervision complexity | High | Follow OTP patterns, start with simple supervision tree |
| Signal system performance | Medium | Use Phoenix PubSub as backend, implement batching |
| Memory usage with many agents | Medium | Implement agent pooling, hibernation strategies |
| Registry split-brain scenarios | High | Use Horde CRDT-based registry, proper cluster config |

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Add Jido runtime configuration to config files
- [ ] Create AshGameServer.Jido module for framework setup
- [ ] Implement base agent module with game-specific patterns
- [ ] Create signal system with CloudEvents integration
- [ ] Set up agent registry using Horde
- [ ] Build agent supervision tree with dynamic supervisors
- [ ] Add agent telemetry integration
- [ ] Create agent testing utilities
- [ ] Update application supervision tree
- [ ] Create example game agent for testing
- [ ] Implement graceful shutdown procedures
- [ ] Add circuit breaker patterns for resilience
- [ ] Test compilation and basic agent startup

## Questions for Pascal
1. Should we create game-specific agent types now (PlayerAgent, NPCAgent) or keep it generic initially?
2. What signal routing patterns do you prefer - direct PubSub topics or structured routing?
3. Do you want agent state to be persisted through Ash resources or kept ephemeral initially?
4. Should we integrate with the existing Telemetry module or create separate agent metrics?
