# Feature Implementation Summary: Project Setup (Section 1.1.1)

## Overview
Successfully implemented the foundation for the Ash Game Server project by setting up all required dependencies, configuration structure, and basic application architecture.

## What Was Built

### Dependencies Added
1. **Core Dependencies:**
   - Jido ~> 1.2.0 - Autonomous agent framework
   - Ash ~> 3.5.33 - Declarative application framework  
   - AshPostgres ~> 2.6.14 - PostgreSQL data layer
   - Spark ~> 2.2.67 - DSL building toolkit

2. **Supporting Libraries:**
   - Phoenix ~> 1.7.21 - Web framework
   - Phoenix.PubSub ~> 2.1 - Real-time pub/sub
   - AshCommanded ~> 0.1.0 - Event sourcing
   - Horde ~> 0.9.1 - Distributed process registry
   - Telemetry suite - Metrics and monitoring

3. **Development Tools:**
   - Dialyxir ~> 1.4 - Static analysis
   - Credo ~> 1.7 - Code quality
   - ExDoc ~> 0.34 - Documentation generation
   - Igniter ~> 0.6.4 - Code generation

### Application Structure Created
1. **Application Module** (`lib/ash_game_server/application.ex`)
   - Supervision tree setup
   - Repo, Telemetry, and PubSub processes

2. **Telemetry Module** (`lib/ash_game_server/telemetry.ex`)
   - VM metrics configuration
   - Telemetry poller setup
   - Ready for game-specific metrics

3. **Repository Module** (`lib/ash_game_server/repo.ex`)
   - AshPostgres configuration
   - PostgreSQL extensions setup
   - Minimum version requirements

### Configuration Structure
Complete config/ directory with:
- `config.exs` - Base configuration with Ash/Spark settings
- `dev.exs` - Development database and logging
- `test.exs` - Test environment with sandboxed database
- `prod.exs` - Production logging levels  
- `runtime.exs` - Runtime configuration for production

## Key Achievements
- ✅ All dependencies successfully installed with compatible versions
- ✅ Project compiles without errors (only third-party warnings)
- ✅ Application supervision tree properly configured
- ✅ Database configuration ready for all environments
- ✅ Development tools integrated for code quality
- ✅ Foundation laid for ECS game server implementation

## Next Steps
With the project foundation complete, the next phases can proceed:
1. Implement Jido agent infrastructure (Section 1.1.2)
2. Set up Ash framework resources and domains (Section 1.1.3)
3. Build Spark DSL for game components (Section 1.1.4)
4. Create ETS storage architecture (Section 1.1.5)

## Technical Notes
- Updated Igniter from 0.5 to 0.6.4 for Ash compatibility
- Added PostgreSQL extensions including ash-functions
- Set minimum PostgreSQL version to 14.0.0
- Configured application for OTP supervision

The project is now ready for core ECS implementation work.
