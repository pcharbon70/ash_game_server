# Section 1.1.3: Ash Framework Setup - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated the Ash Framework into the game server architecture, creating a declarative domain model with resources for game entities and real-time features.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Ash Configuration (`config/config.exs`)
- Configured Ash with JSON API and AshPostgres data layer
- Set up real-time subscriptions with Phoenix.PubSub
- Enabled development-friendly settings

### 2. Base Resource Module (`lib/ash_game_server/resource/base.ex`)
- Created reusable base module with common patterns:
  - UUID primary keys
  - Timestamps (inserted_at, updated_at)
  - Soft delete support with deleted_at field
  - Audit fields (created_by_id, updated_by_id)
  - Automatic filtering of soft-deleted records
  - PubSub notifications for create/update/destroy events

### 3. Domain Structure
Created three core domains:

#### GameCore Domain (`lib/ash_game_server/game_core.ex`)
- Manages game sessions and core mechanics
- GameSession resource with lifecycle actions (start, pause, complete)

#### Players Domain (`lib/ash_game_server/players.ex`)
- Handles player profiles and statistics
- Player resource with experience/leveling system

#### World Domain (`lib/ash_game_server/world.ex`)
- Manages game world entities (to be expanded)

### 4. Example Resources

#### Player Resource (`lib/ash_game_server/players/player.ex`)
- Attributes: username, display_name, status, level, experience
- Actions: create, update_status, add_experience, update_stats
- Validations and constraints for data integrity
- Code interface for programmatic access

#### GameSession Resource (`lib/ash_game_server/game_core/game_session.ex`)
- Attributes: name, status, game_type, player counts, config
- Lifecycle actions: start, pause, resume, complete, cancel
- Player management: add_player, remove_player
- Calculations: is_full, is_active, duration_seconds
- Real-time state updates

### 5. Real-time Features
- Configured PubSub for all resources
- Set up automatic notifications on resource changes
- Prepared for WebSocket integration

## Integration Points

### With Jido Framework
- Resources can be managed by Jido agents
- Agents can subscribe to resource changes via PubSub
- Domain events trigger agent behaviors

### With ECS Architecture
- Resources provide persistent storage for component data
- Domains organize game entities logically
- Real-time updates sync with ECS state changes

## Technical Decisions

1. **Soft Deletes**: Implemented at base level for data recovery
2. **Audit Fields**: Track creation and modification for debugging
3. **Code Interfaces**: Provide clean API for resource operations
4. **Calculations**: Derive computed properties efficiently
5. **Preparations**: Apply filters consistently across queries

## Testing & Verification
- Successfully compiles with all Ash DSL macros
- Resource definitions validated by Ash compiler
- Base module properly inherited by concrete resources
- PubSub configuration verified

## Next Steps
- Implement PostgreSQL migrations when database is configured
- Add authentication and authorization policies
- Create relationships between resources
- Implement more domain-specific resources
- Add GraphQL/JSON API endpoints
