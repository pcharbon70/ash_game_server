## Usage Examples

### Basic Entity Creation
```elixir
# Create a simple entity
{:ok, entity} = Entity.create(archetype: :player, tags: [:human])

# Create with custom metadata
{:ok, entity} = Entity.create(
  archetype: :player,
  metadata: %{level: 10, class: "warrior"},
  tags: [:player, :veteran]
)
```

### Archetype-Based Spawning
```elixir
# Spawn from built-in archetype
{:ok, entity_id} = EntityArchetype.spawn_entity(:player)

# Spawn with variation
{:ok, entity_id} = EntityArchetype.spawn_entity(:player, %{
  variation: :veteran,
  component_overrides: %{health: %{current: 150, max: 150}}
})
```

### Entity Relationships
```elixir
# Create parent-child relationship
EntityRelationships.add_child(parent_id, child_id)

# Create entity group
EntityRelationships.create_group(:party, "Adventure Party")
EntityRelationships.add_to_group(player_id, :party)
```

### Entity Serialization
```elixir
# Export entities
{:ok, serialized_data} = EntitySerialization.export_entities([entity1, entity2])

# Import entities
{:ok, imported_ids} = EntitySerialization.import_entities(serialized_data)
```

## Next Steps

The Entity Management System is now ready for:
1. Integration with the broader game server systems
2. Performance testing under load
3. Integration with Jido agents for AI entity management
4. Extension with game-specific entity types and behaviors

## Conclusion
