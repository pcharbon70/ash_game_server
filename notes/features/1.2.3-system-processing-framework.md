# Feature: System Processing Framework

## Summary
Implement a comprehensive system processing framework for the ECS architecture with scheduling, pipeline execution, coordination, and analytics capabilities to enable high-performance game logic execution.

## Requirements
- [ ] Create base system behavior with configuration and state management
- [ ] Implement tick-based scheduler with priority queues and parallel execution
- [ ] Build execution pipeline with stages, data flow, and error handling
- [ ] Add inter-system coordination with shared state and synchronization
- [ ] Create analytics for performance monitoring and optimization
- [ ] Integrate with existing ECS components and Spark DSL
- [ ] Support both synchronous and asynchronous system execution
- [ ] Provide deadlock detection and prevention mechanisms

## Research Summary
### Existing Usage Rules Checked
- Ash Framework: Resource-based patterns with lifecycle hooks
- Jido: Agent-based system execution with Quantum scheduler
- Spark DSL: Declarative system definitions with validation

### Documentation Reviewed
- Existing System module: Basic struct with priority and query support
- SystemExtension: Comprehensive DSL for system definition
- Jido Scheduler: Built-in quantum scheduler for cron-based execution
- Performance Monitor: Existing analytics and monitoring infrastructure

### Existing Patterns Found
- System definition pattern: `lib/ash_game_server/ecs/system.ex:6-24` - Basic system struct
- DSL extension pattern: `lib/ash_game_server/ecs/system_extension.ex:58-200` - Spark DSL for systems
- Validation pattern: `lib/ash_game_server/ecs/transformers/validate_systems.ex` - System validation
- Ordering pattern: `lib/ash_game_server/ecs/transformers/order_systems.ex` - Priority-based ordering
- Monitoring pattern: `lib/ash_game_server/storage/performance_monitor.ex` - Performance tracking

### Technical Approach
1. **System Base Module**: Extend existing System struct with GenServer behavior for stateful execution
2. **System Scheduler**: Build on Quantum/Jido scheduler with custom priority queue implementation
3. **Pipeline Architecture**: Use Elixir's Flow/GenStage for pipeline stages with back-pressure
4. **Coordination Layer**: Implement via ETS tables for shared state with atomic operations
5. **Analytics Integration**: Extend existing PerformanceMonitor with system-specific metrics

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Deadlock in system dependencies | High | Implement cycle detection in dependency graph |
| Performance overhead from coordination | Medium | Use ETS for lock-free shared state |
| Complex error propagation | Medium | Implement supervision tree with circuit breakers |
| Race conditions in parallel execution | High | Use atomic ETS operations and versioning |

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Create SystemBehaviour module with callbacks
- [ ] Implement SystemScheduler with priority queues
- [ ] Build SystemPipeline with Flow/GenStage
- [ ] Add SystemCoordinator for inter-system communication
- [ ] Create SystemAnalytics with telemetry integration
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests for all components
- [ ] Document system creation patterns
- [ ] Verify integration with existing ECS components

## Questions for Review
1. Should we use Flow/GenStage or implement custom pipeline?
2. What level of isolation should systems have from each other?
3. How should we handle system failures - restart, skip, or cascade?
4. Should system state be persistent or ephemeral?
