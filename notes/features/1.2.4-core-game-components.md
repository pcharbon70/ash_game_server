# Feature: Core Game Components (Task 1.2.4)

## Overview
Implement fundamental game components that provide common functionality needed by most game entities, including transform, gameplay, networking, rendering, and AI components.

## Requirements
- Create reusable components following the ECS ComponentBehaviour
- Ensure components are serializable for persistence
- Support high-performance access via ETS tables
- Include validation and type specifications
- Provide Spark DSL integration for easy configuration

## Research

### Component Categories Analysis
1. **Transform Components**: Core spatial data (position, rotation, scale, velocity)
2. **Gameplay Components**: Game mechanics (health, inventory, stats, abilities)
3. **Network Components**: Multiplayer support (network ID, ownership, replication)
4. **Rendering Components**: Visual representation (sprites, animations, visibility)
5. **AI Components**: Autonomous behavior (AI controller, perception, navigation)

### Implementation Approach
- Use the existing ComponentBehaviour module as the base
- Store component data in ETS tables via EnhancedStorage
- Implement validation through the component DSL
- Add telemetry for performance monitoring
- Create helper functions for common operations

## Risks
- Performance impact if components are too complex
- Memory usage with many component instances
- Serialization overhead for network/persistence
- Type validation complexity for nested data structures

## Checklist

- [ ] Write comprehensive tests for all components
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks
- [ ] Create usage examples
- [ ] Update documentation

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Transform Components
- Position: 3D coordinates (x, y, z)
- Rotation: Quaternion or Euler angles
- Scale: 3D scaling factors
- Velocity: 3D movement vector
- Physics: Mass, friction, gravity influence

### 2. Gameplay Components
- Health: Current/max HP, regeneration rate
- Inventory: Item slots, capacity, weight
- Stats: Strength, agility, intelligence, etc.
- Abilities: Skill list, cooldowns, costs
- StatusEffects: Buffs/debuffs with duration

### 3. Network Components
- NetworkID: Unique identifier across network
- Ownership: Player ID who controls entity
- Replication: Sync strategy and priority
- LagCompensation: Client prediction data
- NetworkStats: Latency, packet loss tracking

### 4. Rendering Components
- Sprite: Texture reference, tint, flip
- Animation: Current state, frame, speed
- Visibility: Render layer, opacity, culling
- LOD: Level of detail settings
- Particle: Emitter configuration

### 5. AI Components
- AIController: Behavior tree or state machine
- Behavior: Current AI state and goals
- Perception: Sensor ranges, detected entities
- Navigation: Pathfinding data, waypoints
- DecisionMaking: Utility scores, priorities

## Success Criteria
- All components compile without warnings
- Tests pass with 100% coverage
- Performance benchmarks meet targets (<1ms access time)
- Components integrate with existing ECS systems
- Documentation and examples are complete
